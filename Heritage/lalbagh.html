        dynasty till 1978, it is now more of a museum, that keeps some of the most exquisite artifacts of the Maratha Empire and
        the Holkar dynasty intact, apart from a rare coin collection, which dates back to the Mughal period.

        columns, grand chandeliers, rich Persian carpets, flying nymphs on the ceiling, Belgium stained glass windows, Greek
        mythological reliefs, Italian style wall paintings, stuffed leopards, and tigers etc. All in all, _Lal Bagh Palace is a
