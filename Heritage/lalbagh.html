        dynasty till 1978, it is now more of a museum, that keeps some of the most exquisite artifacts of the Maratha Empire and
        the Holkar dynasty intact, apart from a rare coin collection, which dates back to the Mughal period.

        columns, grand chandeliers, rich Persian carpets, flying nymphs on the ceiling, Belgium stained glass windows, Greek
