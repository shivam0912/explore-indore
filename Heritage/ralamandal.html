        <h1>Ralamandal Wildlife Sanctuary</h1>
        <p>The oldest sanctuary of Madhya Pradesh, the Ralamandal Wildlife Sanctuary packs a treat for wildlife and
            avifauna
            enthusiasts alike. The River Narmada, which is 150 million years older than River Ganga, graces the
            sanctuary with its
            presence. Home to deer, wild hare, tigers and an umpteen variety of birds, this sanctuary is nothing short
            of paradise.
            Long back, the place served as a hunting ground for the royal family members of Holkars as it had a huge
            population of
            tigers, leopards and deers.In order to protect animals and birds from noise and air pollution emanating from
            nearby
            highway, a green wall of about 8,000 trees was created. It is 180 metres long and 6 metres wide.
