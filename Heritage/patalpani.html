        <h1>Patalpani Waterfall</h1>
        <p>The Patalpani Waterfall is located in the Mhow Tehsil of Indore district and is a popular picnic spot for the
            locals of
            the area. Surrounded by dense forest covers and majestic hills Patalpani plummets from a height of 300
            metres. The
            monsoons swell the falls and may make it risky for close encounters causing accidents. It is best to
            maintain a cautious
            distance from the waterfall during the rain.
            Patalpani is a waterfall in Madhya Pradesh. It has an approximate 91 metres (300 ft). It is on the Choral
            River.

            The water flow is highest immediately after the rainy season (usually after July). It goes almost dry in the
            summer
            season, and the stream is reduced to a trickle. The area around Patalpani is a popular picnic and trekking
            spot.
