        <h1>Bamniya Kund</h1>
        <p>Bamniya Kund is a captivating waterfall 50 kms from Indore in Madhya Pradesh. Falling from a height of 300 feet, the
        waters gush down creating a colourful pool of clear blue waters, brown rocks and verdant green bushes. Nestled away in
        the depth of dense forests in the Malindi region near Indore, the waterfall is hidden away from the clearing.
        
        You will have to reach the Nakheri Dam at the base of the hill and the cascading waters are still a considerably long
        trek away. The trekking trail however, is marked through the beautiful woods and the you can spot several birds, animals
        and exotic plants native to the region. The waterfalls are a delight to the naked eye and a must visit place if you are
        in the area.</p>
