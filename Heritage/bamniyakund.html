        <h1>Bamniya Kund</h1>
        <p>Bamniya Kund is a captivating waterfall 50 kms from Indore in Madhya Pradesh. Falling from a height of 300
            feet, the
            waters gush down creating a colourful pool of clear blue waters, brown rocks and verdant green bushes.
            Nestled away in
            the depth of dense forests in the Malindi region near Indore, the waterfall is hidden away from the
            clearing.

            You will have to reach the Nakheri Dam at the base of the hill and the cascading waters are still a
            considerably long
            trek away. The trekking trail however, is marked through the beautiful woods and the you can spot several
            birds, animals
            and exotic plants native to the region. The waterfalls are a delight to the naked eye and a must visit place
            if you are
            in the area.</p>
