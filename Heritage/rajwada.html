        <h1>Rajwada Palace</h1>
        <p>Located near the famous Kajuri Market in Indore, Rajwada is a magnificent and historical palace that is
            located in the
            city of Indore and was constructed by the Holkars more than 200 years ago. It is a seven-storied structure
            located near
            the Chhatris and serves as an excellent example of royal grandeur and architectural skills.

            Nestled between the crowded streets of the Kajuri Bazar and facing the main square of the city, the Rajwada
            palace also
            faces a well-maintained garden that houses a statue of Queen Ahilya Bai, an artificial waterfall and some
            beautiful
            fountains. Even after all these years, the palace continues to be one of the most famous tourist spots in
            Indore and is
            one of the oldest structures too.</p>
        <h2>History of Rajwada Palace</h2>
        <p>The Rajwada Palace was constructed in 1747 A.D. by the founder of Holkar Dynasty, Malhar Rao Holkar. The
            palace was once
            the centre of all the trading activities in the city. Rajwada has been burnt three times since its
            construction. The
            lower three floors of the palace are made up of stone, while the top levels are made of wood. This kind of
            material used
            for construction made the building very vulnerable to destruction by fire. It was set on fire for the first
            time in 1801
            by the commander Sarjerao Ghadge of the Sindhiya Dynasty.

            Reconstruction took place between 1818 and 1826, and five floors were reconstructed during this time. In
            1834, a second
            fire took place, and the topmost floor was destroyed. The last fire, which broke out in 1984, had caused the
            maximum
            destruction to the structure and the back side of the palace was destroyed entirely. The temple of Malhari
            Martand,
            which is located inside the palace, was also wholly ruined during the riots of 1984.

            Now, only the front part of the original structure remains. The palace has recently been renovated, which
            has managed to
            bring back the old glory to some extent. In the rear part of the palace, a beautiful garden has been
            created. It
            contains fountains, an artificial waterfall and some magnificent pieces of 11th-century sculpture. The
            palace hall is
            now used for art exhibitions and classical music concerts as well.</p>
