        <h1>Tincha Falls</h1>
        <p>Located 25 kilometres from the bustling city of Indore, Tincha Falls are one of the most popular waterfalls in the
        region. The milky white cascade is located in the Tincha village, also where the falls derive their name from. The
        roaring plunge of water at a height of 300 feet is a rain fed waterfall and is primarily a monsoon destination.
        Surrounded by lush green vegetation on all sides and an exhilarating experience in itself,Tincha falls attracts a wide
        array of visitors from all walks of life. The falls are also a canyon, nuzzled in between valleys Tincha is an ideal
        picnic destination and monsoon break away from the chaos that ensues in the cities. The falls also have a small pond
        near the foot of the falls, the stillness of the pond against the roaring descent of water is a sight you must
        definitely not miss.
