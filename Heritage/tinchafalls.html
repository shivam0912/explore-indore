        <h1>Tincha Falls</h1>
        <p>Located 25 kilometres from the bustling city of Indore, Tincha Falls are one of the most popular waterfalls
            in the
            region. The milky white cascade is located in the Tincha village, also where the falls derive their name
            from. The
            roaring plunge of water at a height of 300 feet is a rain fed waterfall and is primarily a monsoon
            destination.
            Surrounded by lush green vegetation on all sides and an exhilarating experience in itself,Tincha falls
            attracts a wide
            array of visitors from all walks of life. The falls are also a canyon, nuzzled in between valleys Tincha is
            an ideal
            picnic destination and monsoon break away from the chaos that ensues in the cities. The falls also have a
            small pond
            near the foot of the falls, the stillness of the pond against the roaring descent of water is a sight you
            must
            definitely not miss.
