<h2>History of Indore</h2><br>
<p>History of this city is inter-weaved with the battles between Marathas, Mughals, and British while its erstwhile reigns
rested with the Zamindars of Malwa plateau on which the city is located. These zamindars or landlords were affluent and
quite dominant in this region.

The families of these zamindars enjoyed the status of being confirmatory Sanads conferred on them by Mughal emperors.
Rao Nandlal Chaudhary was the most influential zamindar of Malwa having an army of 2000 warriors behind him. He also
held a distinctive position in the court of Mughal emperors who presented him two jewel studded swords as a mark of
recognition.
About Indore City
Around 1713, the entire region of Deccan Plateau went into the reigns of Nizam of Hyderabad. While the conflicts were
constantly going on between Marathas and Mughals, Rao Nandlal one visited Indreshwar Temple on the banks of Saraswati
river.

Finding it to be a safe and nature protected place, he built a citadel here and named it Indrapur which later changed
over to Indore under British raj.

Later this area was handed over to Maratha rulers, Holkars under the control of Malhar Rao Holkar, the founder of this
dynasty. Indore was a princely state and an integral part of Holkar Empire until the rise of British in this region.
Till acceding to Indian Union on independence in 1947, it was ruled by them. Later on, it became the summer capital of
Madhya Bharat before its merger into Madhya Pradesh in 1956.</p>
